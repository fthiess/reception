  <title>VHF Radio Reception Study</title>
</head>

<body>
  In order to both support operations during the COVID-19 shelter-at-home directive, and to help plan how to
  optimize future communications activities, during the four weeks from March March 23 through April 13, 2020, Mountain View
  ARES/RACES staff conducted a test of our ability to hear each other from our home locations during our
  regular monday night check-in nets.<br />
  <br />
  <b>What We Did:</b> during check-ins, participating operators recorded how well they could hear the others who were checking
  in using a simple coding scheme:
  <ol>
      <li>Good reception</li>
      <li>Poor reception</li>
      <li>Unintelligable, or no signal heard</li>
  </ol>
  These reception reports were entered into an online form at the end of each net. The form also asked for information
  about each participant's radio and antenna.<br />
  <br />
  <b>How We Analyzed the Data:</b> Leslie (KK6EKN) and Micky (KK6EEI) merged these datasets and produced
  some charts analyzing the results. Forrest (AJ6JN) wrote a program that converted the data into a set of maps for
  each operator showing how well others could hear them, and how well they could hear others. These maps
  can be viewed at <a href=http://k6mtv.org/surveymaps>k6mtv.org/surveymaps</a>.<br />
  <br />
  <b>How to Read the Maps:</b> There are two types of maps at <a href=http://k6mtv.org/surveymaps>k6mtv.org/surveymaps</a>: 
  <b>transmit maps</b> (how well other operators heard a single
  person transmitting) and <b>receiver maps</b> (how well one person heard everyone else). There is one transmit map, named
  <code>callsign-xmit-map.png</code>, for each person who checked in during at least one of the four study weeks, and one receiver
  map, named <code>callsign-rcvr-map.png</code>, for each person who submitted a reception form for one of the four study weeks.<br />
  <br />
  If a participant informed us that they changed their equipment or location from one week to another, they will have
  multiple transmit or receiver maps, one for each equipment/location. Those participants will have a dash and week
  numbers after their callsigns to indicate which week's equipment is being refered to. For example:<br />
  <ul>
      <li><code>AE6EO-1-xmit-map.png</code> uses AE6EO's location and equipment during survey week 1</li>
      <li><code>KM6EEI-34-xmit-map.png</code> uses KM6EEI's location and equipment during survey weeks 3 and 4</li>
  </ul>
  The background for all maps consists of the City of Mountain View, with CERT neighborhood boundaries indicated.
  The icons indicate:
  <ul>
      <li><i>Blue radio</i>: the transmitter on transmit maps, and the receiver on receiver maps.</li>
      <li><i>Green person</i>: Good reception reported</li>
      <li><i>Yellow person</i>: Poor reception reported</li>
      <li><i>Red person</i>: Unintelligible, or no signal reported</li>
  </ul>
