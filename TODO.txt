// Master To-Do list

// BUG: Calls with dashes appear to not be working

// TODO: If call sign has dash and it's not found in operator list, try a second time, truncating the dash
// TODO: If receiver call has a dash, ignore it and anything beyond it (is that right?)
// TODO: Figure out why cfg elements needs to start with capitals
// TODO: Don't use cfg as a global; instead, inject it as an argument to things that need it

// TODO: Break into multiple source files and implement structure from https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout
// TODO: Convert operators, reports, icons to objects (maybe legends and maps, too)
// TODO: Convert into a Go module
// TODO: Using -100 for "no value" to get around Google Sheets exporting empty fields looks bad; maybe "NA" instead?
// TODO: Implement CERT neighborhood labels using existing code + fake operators + transparent icon
// TODO: Switch to using OpenStreetMap base map image, and open source icons
// TODO: Check whether names are the best, including whether it's appropriate to use ...Ptr names
// TODO: Write README file

// FUTURE: Use goroutines to generate multiple maps at the same time
// FUTURE: Consider reading reports out of Google Sheets, instead of CSV
